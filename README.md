# Where's The TP?
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Stop running around trying to find the TP.

When I first thought of this idea I thought it was kinda funny and maybe useful. I had seen a friend post online that they finally found toilet paper after going to a half dozen stores. The more I thought about it the more I realized how useful it could be. In a time when we are supposed to limit our time in contact with others, some of us are forced to run around trying to hunt down toilet paper from store to store. The idea here is for people already in stores to self report, alongside the businesses themselves, one of the products that people are having a hard time finding, toilet paper.

In a future release, other hard to find items, that are crucial to ones well-being, can be added to the app.
